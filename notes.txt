 conclusion: may use JSON to 50,000 bytes of data using current technique.
about 500 users for email and name data.
["danceswithdolphin@gmail.com","2017.03.12 waitlist Wassaw South","1","6"],
80/registration 50,000/80 = 625 registrations
625/30 = 21 months, so self cleaning should work. 

transfer only registrations for selected email between server and client.
automatically delete expired registrations on the server.
implement lock file and read other registrations just prior to upload
implement activity log - emails to joe@josephbonds.com
implement email verification
implement large files

to do:
add server function drive-read-registrations like drive-read, but pass
selected_email, return only registrations for that user.

consider self cleaning trips and registrations.
