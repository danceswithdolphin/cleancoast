Please Share Your Opinion on Plastics Litter
Clean Coast is participating in a Plastic and Litter Reduction Working Group in Chatham County organized by One Hundred Miles. You can help by filling out a short online survey designed to gauge public perceptions of plastics litter and support for various solutions. There are three surveys designed for different interest groups. One survey is for Chatham County consumers/residents, another for Chatham County businesses, and a third for visitors to Chatham County.  

Please take a few minutes to complete whichever surveys you identify with. For instance, if you live in Savannah and own a business there, you can fill out a Consumer, and a Business survey.  Please feel free to share with anyone you know who may be interested. The survey will be open until October 31st.
