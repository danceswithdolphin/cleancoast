<span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif;">Clear plastic bags floating in the water can be mistaken for jellyfish and eaten by turtles, fish, or dolphins.&nbsp; Fish and other marine animals and birds become entangled in fishing line, nets or six-pack rings.&nbsp; Styrofoam eventually breaks up into small pellets that are mistaken for eggs and eaten.&nbsp; We try to minimize these hazards by cleaning up the&nbsp;trash and promoting public awareness of the problem.&nbsp; This photo of a dead&nbsp;loon entangled in balloon string was taken by a Clean Coast member during an outing on one of&nbsp;Georgiaâ€™s pristine barrier islands.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif;">Clean Coast has been active for over twenty five years and has collected tons&nbsp;of trash from our beaches and marshes.&nbsp; We estimate we that we pick up an average&nbsp; 800 -1,000 lbs. of trash per cleanup and we do&nbsp;at least one&nbsp;cleanup&nbsp;each month.&nbsp; Everyone is invited to attend our cleanups, and although we encourage people to become members, non-members are welcome to volunteer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our biggest challenge is that most of&nbsp;these shorelines are not accessible by land.&nbsp; We own a 24ft. Carolina skiff which we use to haul away the trash and we rely on volunteer boat owners to help transport our volunteers.&nbsp; If you are interested in becoming one of our volunteer boat owners, please drop us a line.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:cleancoastmail@gmail.com" target="null"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif;">cleancoastmail@gmail.com</span></a></p>
