<p>Clean Coast is participating in a Plastic and Litter Reduction Working Group in Chatham County organized by One Hundred Miles. You can help by filling out a short online survey designed to gauge public perceptions of plastics litter and support for various solutions. There are three surveys designed for different interest groups. One survey is for <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/OHMConsumerPlastics" target="_blank">Chatham County consumers/residents</a>, another for <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/OHMPlasticBusiness" target="_blank">Chatham County businesses</a>, and a third for <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/OHMTouristPlastics" target="_blank">visitors to Chatham County</a>.</p>

<p>Please take a few minutes to complete whichever surveys you identify with. For instance, if you live in Savannah and own a business there, you can fill out a Consumer, and a Business survey.  Please feel free to share with anyone you know who may be interested. The survey will be open until October 31st.</p>

                  <h3>Bottled Waterâ€™s Enormous Footprint</h3>
                  <p>Beverage containers are by far the most numerous item we find on our cleanups, and a very large portion consists of plastic water bottles. &nbsp;But the environmental foot print of bottled water goes far beyond its predominant presence in the litter washing onto our shorelines. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.wheelsforwishes.org/bottled-water-footprint/" target="_blank">This infographic</a> created by Wheels for Wishes spells it out pretty clearly.</p>
