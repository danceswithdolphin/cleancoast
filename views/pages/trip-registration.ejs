<p>Your identity for trip registration purposes is your email address.  If you are on a private computer, your email address will be privately stored on your computer for a default when you return to this site.  If this is your first use, you will be sent an email with a verification button.  Please click the verification button in that email to help us defeat spammers. You may use this website to make reservations before you have been verified as long as you ultimately do the verification.</p>
<p>If you are in a public shared computer such as a library, you should check the "this is a public computer box, to avoid possibly revealing your email address to subsequent users of this computer. In this case, your email address will not be "remembered" on this computer.</p>
<p>On your return to this site, the email address will contain the address you used on your last visit from this computer.  If more than one person uses your computer, you may click the "not me" button to enable the entry of another email address and both addresses will be "remembered" as future choices.</p>
<Having accurated email addresses is important to us since we send directions and notifications to you prior to the trip.</p>
